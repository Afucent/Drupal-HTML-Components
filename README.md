# HTML Components

This repository contains raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files designed to create reusable components/modules for CMS platforms such as Drupal, AEM, and others. The goal is to provide clean, modular, and easily integrable components for various web projects.

## Components Overview

### Included Components

1. **50-50 Section**: A layout component divided into two equal sections (50% width each), typically used for showcasing content side-by-side.

2. **Footer**: A responsive footer component that includes navigation links, copyright information, and social media icons.

3. **Accordion**: An interactive component for organizing content into collapsible sections.

4. **Case Studies**: A visually appealing layout for displaying case studies or portfolio items.

All the above components are contained within a single `index.html` file, along with corresponding CSS and JavaScript.

## File Structure

```plaintext
project/
|-- index.html
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the `index.html` file into your project.

2. Use the appropriate HTML structure from the `index.html` file to integrate the components into your project.

4. Modify styles and scripts as needed to match your design requirements.

## Code Standards

- **HTML**: Follows semantic HTML5 standards.
- **JavaScript**: Clean and modular, avoiding global variables.

## Future Enhancements

- Add accessibility features (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
- Create additional component variants.
- Optimize CSS/JS for performance.
